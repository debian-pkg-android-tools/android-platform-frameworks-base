In d/copyright, we exclude core/res/res/values-mcc310-mnc170 which is a symlink
to another directory. In d/rules, we create this symlink before the build
process starts. We do this because neither dpkg-source nor git-buildpackage can
handle a symlink to a directory in an upstream source tarball. Hopefully Google
will remove this symlink in a future release.

Therefore, check this symlink before importing an future release of this
package.
