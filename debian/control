Description: Android Asset Packaging Tool
 The Android Asset Packaging Tool (aapt) takes your application resource
 files, such as the AndroidManifest.xml file and the XML files for your
 Activities, and compiles them. An R.java is also produced so you can
 reference your resources from your Java code. This tool allows you to view,
 create, and update Zip-compatible archives (zip, jar, apk). It can also
 compile resources into binary assets.

 along with the device configuration will emit the set of Split APKs to install,
 following the same logic that would have been emitted
