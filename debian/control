Package: aapt
Architecture: amd64 i386 arm arm64 armeb mips mipsel mips64 mips64el
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Android Asset Packaging Tool
 The Android Asset Packaging Tool (aapt) takes your application resource
 files, such as the AndroidManifest.xml file and the XML files for your
 Activities, and compiles them. An R.java is also produced so you can
 reference your resources from your Java code. This tool allows you to view,
 create, and update Zip-compatible archives (zip, jar, apk). It can also
 compile resources into binary assets.

Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: APK split and selection tool
 Generates the logic for selecting a Split APK given some target Android device
 configuration.
 .
 Using the flag --generate will emit a JSON encoded tree of rules that must be
 satisfied in order to install the given Split APK. Using the flag --target
 along with the device configuration will emit the set of Split APKs to install,
 following the same logic that would have been emitted
